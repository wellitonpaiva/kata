Project created to do some katas to improve my TDD.

# First KATA is Three Men's Morris

## Rules for Three Men's Morris
1. Three men's morris is played by two players, with pieces placed on the points of the lined board shown in the diagram.
2. The board starts empty, each player holding all his pieces in hand.
3. At first, each player in turn puts one piece on the board, at any vacant point.
4. Once all pieces are on the board, a player instead moves one of his pieces along a marked line to an adjacent empty point.
5. If a piece placed or moved as in rules 3 or 4 forms a row of three along a marked line (called a mill), he wins the game.
